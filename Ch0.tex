If $A$ is a set and $x$ and element of the set, then $x\in A$, otherwise $x \notin A$. A set with no elements is denoted by $\nullset$, and a set $A$ is called nonempty if $A\neq \nullset$. If all elements of a set $A$ are also the elements of a set $B$, then $B$ \textit{contains} $A$, or $A \subset B$, therefore $A \subset A$ and $\nullset\in A$ hold trivially. We will often use this property to check for equality of two sets $A$ and $B$, i.e., $A=B \iff A\subset B$ and $B\subset A$.
